## Joachims Milchm√§dchenrechnungs Score (JMS)

JMS is a calculated score that represents a simplified expected value based on the delta of the short option, a mental stop loss, and a take profit goal. The score is normalized using the Buying Power Reduction (BPR).

### Calculation

The JMS score allows different underlyings to be compared, providing a quick overview of their relative performance. A higher JMS score indicates a better trade setup.

**Current Settings:**
- **Take Profit Goal:** 60% of the maximum profit (JMS_TP_GOAL = 0.6)
- **Mental Stop Loss:** 200% loss relative to the collected premium (JMS_MENTAL_STOP = 2)

This means that a position is closed when it reaches 60% of the maximum profit or when the loss reaches 200% of the collected premium.
